LBW serves as a predictor of premature mortality and/or morbidity.[1] LBW children have greater developmental and growth problems, are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease later in life, have a greater rate of respiratory conditions, and have higher rates of cognitive problems such as cerebral palsy, and visual, auditory, and intellectual impairments.[2-5] From the perspective of maternal health outcomes, LBW indicates maternal exposure to health risks in all categories of health factors, including her health behaviors, access to health care, the social and economic environment the mother inhabits, and environmental risks to which she is exposed.

A systematic review of the sexual risk among pregnant and mothering teens concludes that pregnancy is a marker for current and future sexual risk behavior and adverse outcomes.[1] Pregnant teens are more likely than older women to receive late or no prenatal care, have eclampsia, puerperal endometritis, systemic infections, low birthweight, preterm delivery, and severe neonatal conditions.[2, 3] Pre-term delivery and low birthweight babies have increased risk of child developmental delay, illness, and mortality.[4] Additionally, there are strong ties between teen birth and poor socioeconomic, behavioral, and mental outcomes. Teenage women who bear a child are much less likely to achieve an education level at or beyond high school, much more likely to be overweight/obese in adulthood, and more likely to experience depression and psychological distress.[5-7]",https://wonder.cdc.gov/natality.html

The removal of discriminatory policies and practices has impacted acts of racism, but has had little effect on structural racism, like residential segregation, resulting in lingering structural inequalities. Although this area of research is gaining interest, structural forms of racism and their relationship to health inequities remain under-studied.[1] Residential segregation remains prevalent in many areas of the country and may influence both personal and community well-being. Residential segregation of Blacks and Whites is considered to be a fundamental cause of health disparities in the US and has been linked to poor health outcomes, including mortality, a wide variety of reproductive, infectious, and chronic diseases, and other adverse conditions.[1,2] Structural racism is also linked to poor-quality housing and disproportionate exposure to environmental toxins.[3] Individuals living in segregated neighborhoods often experience increased violence, reduced educational and employment opportunities, limited access to quality health care and restrictions to upward mobility.[2,3]",https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml
Social Associations,num_associations,"Number of membership associations per 10,000 population.",https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/measures-data-sources/county-health-rankings-model/health-factors/social-and-economic-factors/family-social-support/social-associations,"Poor family support, minimal contact with others, and limited involvement in community life are associated with increased morbidity and early mortality. A 2001 study found that the magnitude of health risk associated with social isolation is similar to the risk of cigarette smoking.[1] Furthermore, social support networks have been identified as powerful predictors of health behaviors, suggesting that individuals without a strong social network are less likely to make healthy lifestyle choices than individuals with a strong network. A study found that people living in areas with high levels of social trust are less likely to rate their health status as fair or poor than people living in areas with low levels of social trust.[2] Researchers have argued that social trust is enhanced when people belong to voluntary groups and organizations because people who belong to such groups tend to trust others who belong to the same group.[3]",https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2016/econ/cbp/2016-cbp.html
Flu Vaccinations,pct_vaccinated,Percentage of fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare enrollees that had an annual flu vaccination.,https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/measures-data-sources/county-health-rankings-model/health-factors/clinical-care/quality-of-care/flu-vaccinations,"Influenza is a potentially serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and even death. Every year there are millions of influenza infections, hundreds of thousands of flu-related hospitalizations, and thousands of flu-related deaths. An annual flu vaccine is the best way to help protect against influenza and may reduce the risk of flu illness, flu-related hospitalizations, and even flu-related death [1].",https://data.cms.gov/mapping-medicare-disparities

From 1995 to 2015, the percentage of female adults, age 25 to 29 who completed at least a bachelor’s degree went from 14% to 24% for blacks, 10% to 18% for Hispanics, and 28% to 45% in whites. And from 1995 to 2015, the percentage of male adults, age 25 to 29 who completed at least a bachelor’s degree went from 14% to 19% for blacks, 7% to 13% for Hispanics, and 27% to 38% in whites. However, college enrollment race/ethnicity gaps are decreasing. In 2005, white recent high school graduates were 11 percentage points more likely to enroll in college than their black and Hispanic peers. In 2015, these gaps had decreased to 8 percentage points for black and 5 percentage points for Hispanic students.[3]",https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/data-files/index.html

In 2017, approximately 10,900 Americans were killed in alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes.[1] The annual cost of alcohol-related crashes totals more than $44 billion. Drivers between the ages of 21 and 24 cause 27% of all alcohol-impaired deaths.[1]",ftp://ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/fars/

The role of the built environment is important for encouraging physical activity. Individuals who live closer to sidewalks, parks, and gyms are more likely to exercise.[1-3]",PAID DATASET (ArcGIS Business Analyst)
